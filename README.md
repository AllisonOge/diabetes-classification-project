# diabetes-classification-project
A model to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. The project is based on a tutorial [`Python TensorFlow for Machine Learning â€“ Neural Network Text Classification Tutorial`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtRLrQ3Ev-U&t=3681s) by `freeCodeCamp.org` implemented with a little of my touch.

## Content of the project
- Keras and TensorFlow libraries to build neural networks
- W&B (weights and biases) for visualization and model versioning
- Custom training and evaluation loop
